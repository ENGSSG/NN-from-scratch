Also if you do want to learn how NN works check out [3blue1brown's video series](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk).\n","\n","I have linked my github repositry where I uploaded my calculation for the whole model. Certain bits of code had to be fixed from Samson's video and I'll mention it below.\n","\n","[Setting up the nodes and functions](https://github.com/ENGSSG/NN-from-scratch/blob/main/NN%20setup.jpeg)\n","\n","[How to differentiate softmax function](https://github.com/ENGSSG/NN-from-scratch/blob/main/Softmax%20differentiation.jpeg)"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\n","**Things to keep in mind for this NN**\n","* This was a project that was written on Kaggle, so the files are [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data). I wanted to store it directly to the repositry, but it was too large.\n","* For cost(or loss) function, categorical cross entropy equation was used, which is y*ln(a2). As this is a categorical problem and it makes the equation much simpler.\n","* Softmax function has been changed to prevent overflowing.\n","* The sum function used for b1 & b2 in Samson's video does not actually reflect the model. (He summed all the values in the array. Where you should only add it accross column.)\n","* Placed Onehotencode outside of the loop as it is not necessary and causes extra calculation.\n","* If anyone wants to see how derivation works for softmax and differentiation of a to z, please look at this blog from [Thomas
